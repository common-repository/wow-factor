Create awesome TV-style videos on your mobile using the free Wow Factor app. And show those videos here on your website, automatically.

== Description ==

Do you struggle to type words for your blog or website?

The problem with blogs and websites is they require typing. 

It's painful.

What if you didn't have to type anymore?

Instead, you just hold up your mobile, and start talking.

And AMAZING content appears on your website.

Beautiful, TV-show quality content.

And special effects - you'll look like you've paid thousands of dollars for a TV studio to create this content.

But it's just you.  And your mobile.

And it's FREE.

Try it out.


= It helps you get more visitors =

The app not only shows your videos here on your website.

It also pushes them to **important** places online.

Like Facebook and Twitter.

And it creates your page content in a way that Google LOVES. (So do Yahoo, Bing and other search engines.)

Basically, your videos will be all over the place, promoting you and your website.

And each video can have a link that points back here to your website.

People click the links to visit your website.

It's easy. Natural. Safe. And fun.
